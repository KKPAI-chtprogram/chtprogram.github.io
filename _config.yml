## Program Summary

'**Background**'

'**The Emergence of the COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM**'

'The emergence of the COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM is out of our social concerns on the low-income earner families particularly who were affected by armed conflicts between the govâ€™t troops and rebel groups, who are living with extended relatives, no permanent house and anywhere in this city and nearby areas, who are classified as low-income earners, with less education and livelihood skills and through series of studies with a group of Professionals and friends from different sectors of society but with one common objective; to help the needy.'
